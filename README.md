# 3D_pyrography_etching_system
3.P.E.S is a pyrography etching system. This system is capable of wood burning an image that the  user manually engraves via a joystick or sends to our machine via a smartphone application. The reason  we designed this system is because of our interest in 3-D printing. We wanted to take an artistic and unique approach to implementing an x, y, z theta platform.
